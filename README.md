# Pandas Basics

Author: Chew Hong Jun  

This repository is an introduction to python with a focus on _python syntax_ and _Programming logic_ which is similar for all languages !  
It will have a collection of code snippets and tutorials all mashed together!

## 1. Introduction <a name="1"></a>

> [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

> *What can you do with Python?* Just about anything, and most things quite easily. Topics like data analysis, machine learning, web development, desktop applications, robotics, and more are all things that you can immediately begin doing with Python without much effort.
